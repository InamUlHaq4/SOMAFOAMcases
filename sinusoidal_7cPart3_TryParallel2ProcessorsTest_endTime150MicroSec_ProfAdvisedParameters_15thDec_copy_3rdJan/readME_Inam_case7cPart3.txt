This is the copy of 7cPart3. Since rerun wwas not successful, this fresh case will be run until 1200 micro sec  (4x more time) to observe is steady state achieved or not. 

Results:

This simulation was manually stopped on 16th Jan, 2024 (while the simulation was successfully running) i.e. after approx. 16 days, it successfully simulated approx 284 micro sec in these 16 days.

The steady state was seen to have been achieved in 230 micro sec of simulation time. Steady state is confirmed to remain stable  until 284 micro sec of simulation time. HEnce it is concluded that:

Steady state is achieved for this case in 230 micro sec simulation time.

Steady state stability is confirmed until 284 micro sec simulation time.

Initially simulation are observed to be slow but eventually simulation speed increases (as the simulation time progresses).

The average simulation time is expected to be (284/16 = approx. 18 micro sec/day)
