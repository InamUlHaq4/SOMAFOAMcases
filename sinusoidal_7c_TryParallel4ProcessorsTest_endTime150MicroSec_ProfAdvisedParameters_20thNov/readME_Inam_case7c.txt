???? see slide for case 7c

???THis case crashed. THe case was ran using somaFoam solver on 4 cores. The simulation ran but somehow crashes. This is the ?????????first ???? case after meeting with Dr Luis, and changing some parameters as sdvised by Dr Luis (electroMagnetics).

???Now I prepared the case 7a, that is running on same parameters as before (my own guessed ones), on 8 cores to confirm simulataion completion.
