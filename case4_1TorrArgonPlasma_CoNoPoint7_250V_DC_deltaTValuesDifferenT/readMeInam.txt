THis case (Co. No 0.1, deltaTMin 1e-15) was prepared to see if results differ if courant number is fixed to 0.1 while timeStep is altered. 1e-15 is used in helium case, so I use it here too. In previous similar simulation (case name: case4_1TorrArgonPlasma_CoNoPoint7_250V_DC_repeatibilityTest, the only difference in these cases is the different deltaTMin value 1e-40 as well as Co. No 0.7)).

//Q: Is there any criteria to use while choosing deltaTMin ????

The steady state was achieved in 70 micro sec after which there was not much change in results. However, the simulation was ran for 282 micro sec to ensure steady state lasts. How long it took ? 212 HRS until simulation was stopped at 282 micro sec.

Result: Same profile generated as before.
