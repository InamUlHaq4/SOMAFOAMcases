This case is running in parallel on two cores. This case restricts Co. No to 0.7 by reducing the deltaTMin to 1e-40.

Until, 19th Dec, 2023, only 40+ micro sec are simulated. When did I start the simulation, I guess 11th Dec, then the case is slow, but lets see how far it goes.

Today is 21st Dec, and only 40.4 micro sec are simulated, meanwhile at the same simulation time, the profile has again shown a sudden change, making the profile inverted U shape, which is never the expected profile.
